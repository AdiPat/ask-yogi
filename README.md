## Background

It all started with a simple idea: What if you could ask a Yogi anything? Inspired by the **Ask Sadhguru** feature in his **Miracle of Mind app**, I wanted to create something even more flexible—a system where users could interact with a Yogi whose personality and wisdom could be shaped to match their needs. After all, every Yogi has their own unique way of answering life’s big (and small) questions, so why not bring that individuality into AI?

That’s how Ask Yogi was born.

This project is part of a larger initiative—Yoga API, developed by ShinCy Labs as a special tribute to MahaShivRatri 2025. We wanted to build something meaningful, useful, and open-source for the world on this auspicious day. And in the process of creating Yoga API, we stumbled upon a cool idea—why not let people talk to a Yogi? Thus, Ask Yogi became its own feature, allowing users to have deep, insightful, and even playful conversations with a digital sage.

Right now, Ask Yogi runs entirely on the command line—simple, fast, and distraction-free. But who knows? If the response is great, we might build a full-fledged interface in the future. For now, we’re laser-focused on perfecting the core experience.

Want to test it out? Go ahead—ask away!
